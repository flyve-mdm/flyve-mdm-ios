## 1. Enrollment

### 1.1 Invitation

The owner of the device must receive in his email account an invitation, sent from either the [Web MDM Dashboard](http://flyve.org/web-mdm-dashboard/) or [Flyve MDM Plugin](http://flyve.org/glpi-plugin/) for GLPI.

The user must open the email from the device, the invitation contains a deeplink with the following information:

* the URL of the backend for REST API requests
* a user API token belonging to a human user account
* an invitation token
* the name of the company’s helpdesk
* the phone number of the company’s helpdesk
* the website of the company’s helpdesk
* the email of the company’s helpdesk

### 1.2 Enroll

At the moment of opening the deeplink:

* If the Agent is installed in the device, it will Open with the App and start the enrollment.

</div>

* If it isn't, it will take the user to the AppStore to download it.

The Agent will send to the backend the information provided by the user and the one collected from the device, to save it in the GLPI database.

## 2. Management

The management of the devices is made through the Web Dashboard or the Flyve MDM plugin, from there the Administrator can apply the different policies and features to the devices.

### 2.1 Fleets

The Administrator must create a new fleet in which to add the policies needed in the IT infrastructure, later the Agents are assigned to the corresponding fleets, they can only be assigned to one fleet, once the device is assigned the policies are applied instantaneously.

### 2.2 Files and Apps

Once the Fleet is applied with the deployment of the apps and files, the Agent will receive a MQTT message with the information to start the download using an HTTP request.

## 3. Connectivity

The connectivity between the Agent and the backend is through the MQTT, a Machine to Machine (M2M) protocol, through it the Agent receives the policies and other security commands, maintaining a connection with the backend, thanks to the concepts of will and testament of the protocol.

The Agent connects to the MQTT broker at the enrollment process, when there is a connectivity with the broker the Agent will send an Online status and will be displayed on screen, when it is disconnected the broker will send an Offline status on behalf of the Agent.

## 4. User information

Only the user information can be updated from the Agent, such as phone number, name and emails.

## 5. Unenrollment

To unenroll an Agent, a MQTT message is sent to the device running this agent. Once the unenrollment is done, the agent sends a MQTT message to acknowledge the unenrollment request.

The backend waits for this acknowledgment to actually delete the agent from the database. The delay to send this acknowledgment is undetermined but should happen because the device is in the end of a cycle but still owned by legitimate user and is used in normal operations.
